Tooling:
    We implemented our Turing machine with Python. Our implementation does 
not require any additional installation of packages, nor libraries. However, 
we can only guarantee to work with python 3.9.  

Sources: 
	MonoTM.py		 

Tests: 
    MonoTmExample.py 
    
Implementation: 
    #TODO
 

Status: 
	Fully functional nondeterministic Turing Machine simulator.
